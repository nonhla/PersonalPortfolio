# Personal Portfolio Using React

Hi there âœ‹!

This is personal portfolio i put together for SovTech, It`s 
a static single page application where i used React and Next.js.

I Learned quite a bit creating this project since it was my first time using React and its frameworks.

One big problem i encountered was the versioning with the React-Router-Dom, I initally used version 5 and there significant changes made between v5 and v6. 

I hope you enjoy it ðŸ˜‰!
